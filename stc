Scope,Get,Positioning,DOM,CSS
•	JavaScript has global scope and local scope within functions when variables are declared with var. The unified field is the ultimate global scope, where an impulse anywhere is an impulse everywhere. 
•	Static positioning flows box elements from top to bottom, and inline elements from left to right. Relative positioning keeps the space in the original flow, but displays the element at an offset. Absolute positioning takes the element out of the flow and places it relative to the "containing element". Fixed positioning takes the element out of the flow and places it relative to the browser window. Transcendental consciousness is when our mind goes outside the window of the relative.
•	Although data can be submitted with a GET request, the fact that it’s on the URL makes it clumsy and less secure (not what GET is meant for). Instead data should be submitted with a POST request, which is specifically meant for taking data, and keeps things clean. Like the principle of diving, we want to take the right angle and let go.
•	The DOM is an API for the JavaScript programmer to manipulate any element of the page in code. This is parallel to the TM and TM-Sidhi programs being API's for anyone to contact and act at the level of the Unified Field.

-CSS enhances Webpage by giving different visual styles to HTML elements, changing their preset default appearance. The nature of life is to grow.
Similarly It is a best practice to keep CSS in a separate file, doing so makes your pages more flexible. Purification leads to progress.
